# MDX

Theme UI is designed to work seamlessly with [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), a format
allowing you to write JSX in your Markdown files & use Markdown files as React
components. This makes it easy to style text content with Theme UI and add
themed, interactive components like charts or sliders to content without writing
prose in JSX.

While many Theme UI projects use MDX, as of `v0.15` itâ€™s not included in the
default `theme-ui` package to reduce bundle size. Install the `@theme-ui/mdx`
package alongside `theme-ui` to use MDX with Theme UI.

```sh
npm i @theme-ui/mdx @mdx-js/react
```
