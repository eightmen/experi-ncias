# Getting Started with Gatsby

To use Theme UI with [Gatsby][], install and use
[`gatsby-plugin-theme-ui`](/packages/gatsby-plugin).

```sh
npm i theme-ui @theme-ui/mdx gatsby-plugin-theme-ui @emotion/react @mdx-js/react
```

Add the plugin to your `gatsby-config.js`.

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: ['gatsby-plugin-theme-ui'],
}
```

Create a theme file located at `src/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/index.js`.

```js
// example theme file
const theme = {
  colors: {
    text: '#000',
    background: '#fff',
  },
}

export default theme
```

With `gatsby-plugin-theme-ui`, there is no need to manually use the
`ThemeProvider` component. Use the [`sx` prop](/sx-prop),
[color modes](/color-modes), and other features just as you would with any other
application.

For more information, see the documentation for
[`gatsby-plugin-theme-ui`](/packages/gatsby-plugin).
