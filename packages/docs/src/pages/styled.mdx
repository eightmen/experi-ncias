# Styled

As of Theme UI 0.6, `Styled` components dict was renamed to `Themed` to avoid
confusion with `styled` components constructor function from `@emotion/styled`.

As of Theme UI 0.15, `Themed` components have moved to the optional
`@theme-ui/mdx` package.

[Go to the docs for Themed](/mdx/themed).
