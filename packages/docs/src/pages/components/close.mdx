# Close

Button with close (Ã—) icon.

```js
import { Close } from 'theme-ui'
```

```jsx live=true
<Close />
```

The `Close` component renders as a `<button>` element by default. Pass any button attributes as props to the component.

## Variants

Close component variants can be defined in the `theme.buttons` object.
The Close component uses `theme.buttons.close` as its default variant style.

```js
// example theme variants
{
  buttons: {
    close: {
      color: 'primary',
    }
  }
}
```
