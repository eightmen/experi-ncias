# Embed

Responsive iframe for video embeds.

```js
import { Embed } from 'theme-ui'
```

```js live=true
<Embed src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GNCd_ERZvZM" />
```

Props besides [`sx`](/sx-prop) will be passed to the `iframe` itself, since
using a [`title` prop](https://accessibility.18f.gov/iframes/) or other labels are recommended
for accessibility.

Embed variants can be defined anywhere in the `theme` object.
