# Variants

To add groups of styles based on theme values, you can take advantage of the
_Variants_ feature. Variants allow you to define the styles used across multiple
buttons, typographic elements, or any element in your `theme` object.

For example, you can define `primary` and `secondary` variants for buttons and
use colors from the theme.

```js
// example theme with variants
{
  colors: {
    primary: '#07c',
    secondary: '#639',
  },
  buttons: {
    primary: {
      color: 'white',
      bg: 'primary',
    },
    secondary: {
      color: 'white',
      bg: 'secondary',
    },
  },
}
```

With the `theme` object above, the `buttons` variants can be referenced by any
tag through [the `sx` prop](/sx-prop). Inside `sx`, the variant should begin
with a top-level key from the theme, then use dot notation to access nested
objects.

```jsx
<button sx={{ variant: 'buttons.primary' }} />
```

When using the [built-in components](/components), you can use the `variant`
prop directly on components, instead of inside the `sx` object.

Most [components have their own variant group](/components/variants) (“variant
group” being a top-level theme key, e.g. the
[`Button` component](/components/button) uses `buttons`), and some also have a
default variant they’ll utilize from that variant group (e.g. `Button` defaults
to using `primary`).

This means using `<Button />` without specifying a variant has the same result
as the snippet above, since the default variant name (`primary`) matches a
variant name inside the `buttons` group. If you want a different variant from
the same group, you can give its key without specifying the group:

```jsx
<Button variant="secondary" />
```

You can also use variants outside of a component’s default variant group with
dot notation. This is especially useful for combining layout components without
further nesting your DOM, such as adding container styles to a grid or flexbox.
By using the [`Grid` component](/components/grid) here with a variant, you’re
able to use `Grid`’s props combined with the variant styles.

```jsx
<Grid variant="layouts.container" columns={3} gap={3} />
```

<Note>

Variants can use any name you choose, and deeply nested objects can be accessed
with dot notation. You could use this to organize more complex variants, like
`<Button variant="outline.small" />`,
