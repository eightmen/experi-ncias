# TypeScript

Theme UI is written in TypeScript.

While most APIs in Theme UI should _just work_ in TypeScript,
there are a few advanced use cases which will differ slightly.
This guide is intended to cover those use cases.

## Exact theme type

The [`Theme` type](/theme-spec) represents all possible themes.

It might be what you need when you're writing a library of reusable components
or an app where the theme object is provided by the user and kept in the database.
However, it's not the most convenient way to think about the theme,
when building a blog or a landing page.

To know the exact type of your particular theme on type level,
you can use an identity "constructor" function to narrow the type.

```tsx
const makeTheme = <T extends Theme>(t: T) => t

const theme = makeTheme({
  colors: {
    background: 'white',
    text: 'black',
    blue: {
      light: '#187abf',
      dark: '#235a97',
    },
  },
})

export type ExactTheme = typeof theme

// No error
const lightBlue = theme.colors.blue.light
```

You can then reexport `useThemeUI` hook with narrowed type.

```tsx
import { ThemeUIContextValue } from 'theme-ui'

interface ExactContextValue extends Omit<ThemeUIContextValue, 'theme'> {
  theme: ExactTheme
}

export const useTheme = (useThemeUI as unk
