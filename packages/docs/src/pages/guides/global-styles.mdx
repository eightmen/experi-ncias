# Global Styles

Theme UI offers a `Global` component (that wraps Emotionâ€™s) for adding global
CSS with theme-based values.

By default (or, unless the
[`useRootStyles` configuration option](/theming#configuration-flags)is
disabled), the `ThemeProvider` component will apply styles in
`theme.styles.root` to the `<html>` element. It will also apply `color` and
`background-color` styles based on `theme.colors.text` and
`theme.colors.background` respectively.

<Note>
  Generally, you should try to avoid adding CSS to global scope. Many styles can
  be safely encapsulated into a component without the need for global styles
