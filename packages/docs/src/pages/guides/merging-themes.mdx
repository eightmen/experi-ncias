# Merging Themes

Sometimes it's useful to split a theme across multiple files, use a preset as the basis for a custom theme, or combine two or more themes together.
Since themes are plain JavaScript objects, any merging strategy will work.
This guide shows a few common ways to merge themes together.

## Using a preset

To use a preset as the basis for a custom theme, it's recommended that you use a deep merge utility.
The `theme-ui` package exports a preconfigured version of the `deepmerge` package that can be used for this.

```js
// example theme based on preset-future
import future from '@theme-ui/preset-future'
import { merge } from 'theme-ui'

export default merge(future, {
  fonts: {
    body: 'Montserrat, sans-serif',
  },
})
```

## Multiple files

While there is absolutely nothing wrong with keeping an entire theme in a single file, you can split a theme into multiple files (or modules).

```js
// example theme/colors.js
export default {
  text: '#000',
  background: '#fff',
  primary: '#07c',
}
```

```js
// example theme/fonts.js
export default {
  body: 'system-ui, sans-serif',
  heading: 'Baskerville, Georgia, serif',
  monospace: 'Menlo, monospace',
}
```

```js
// example theme/index.js
import colors from './colors'
import fonts from './fonts'

export default {
  colors,
  fonts,
}
```

## Merging theme values from multiple files

For the core scales (`colors`, `fontSizes`, `space`, etc), itâ€™s typically simpler to understand a theme when values are defined in one file.
However, especially for projects with many [styles](/styling-mdx) or [variants](/guides/variants), you may want to split values that end up
as part of one object across multiple files. You can use the same kind of imports combined with the `merge` utility for this.

```js
// example theme/index.js
import { merge } from 'theme-ui'
import colors from './colors'
import fonts from './fonts'
import textStyles from './styles/text'
import tableStyles from './styles/tables'
import { buttons, forms, links } from './variants'

export default {
  colors,
  fonts,
  styles: merge(textStyles, tableStyles),
  buttons,
  forms,
  links,
}
```
